This directory contains the GNU terminal control utilities tput and
tabs.  tput is a program to enable shell scripts to portably use
special terminal capabilities.  Although its interface is similar to
that of terminfo-based tput programs, it actually uses termcap.  tabs
is a program to set hardware terminal tab settings.
 
See the file INSTALL for compilation and installation instructions.
